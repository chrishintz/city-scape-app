            # split the tweet's content into a bunch of words, examine each word

                        # add 1 to the score for that key in the dictionary! (for THIS TWEET ONLY)
                        count_dictionary[key] += 1

                            # the above loop will happen for each word in each tweet,
                            # so tweets may have count_dictionaries with scores of
                            # multiple 1's, 0's or anything else.

                            # later, make it so that if the entire count_dictionary score is
                            # 0, the tweet isn't even saved in the dictionary.

                    ####### regex approach:
                    # iterate through the dictionary keys...
                    # for key, value_list in Time.dictionary.items():

                    #     for value in value_list:
                    #
                    #         if re.search(value, tweet.text.lower()):

                                # skip and do not save in db

                    # FUTURE REFACTOR:  just assign a time_guess to a tweet, skipping assignment
                    # of a bunch of empty scores to each tweet.
                        #   for tweet in tweets:
                        #     time_guess = ""

                        # repeat for night
