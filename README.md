## Python and Django Installation

1. type `brew install python3` in your terminal (for those that haven’t installed it yet)
  - you can check if you already have python3 installed by typing `brew search python` in your terminal

2. next install pip version 8.0.2 by typing `pip install -U pip` in your terminal
  - upgrading may be necessary, you can do this by typing `pip install --upgrade pip` in your terminal

3. then type `pyvenv cityscapeenv`, and then `source cityscapeenv/bin/activate`
  - type `python` to make sure you are using python3

4. exit python3 and then type `pip install Django==1.9.2` in your terminal (upgrade pip if necessary)

5. enter python again, test to see if Django is working by typing `import django; print(django.get_version())` in your terminal, ‘1.9.2’ should be returned

6. to start your server, type `python manage.py runserver` in your terminal
  - your server will run on localhost:8000

7. if you stop your server, before restarting, type 'source cityscapeenv/bin/activate' (cityscapeenv = name of your environment) to get the environment up and running.

## To install dependencies:
  - **requirements.txt** is similar to a Gemfile – it's in your root directory and lists all the extensions (and their versions) that make your project go.

  - Since we are working from a merged branch where **requirements.txt** already exists, just `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies (like `bundle install` in Rails)

      - **There may be dependency conflicts between packages, in which case the mass
      install command above will not actually install every package listed in the
      requirements file.** You'll find this to be the case if you are told a package
      or module is missing when trying to start your server. In this case, just individually install the package, and try starting your server again. Repeat one-by-one if multiple modules are missing.

      - NB: `pip install -U -r requirements.txt` will *update* dependencies if there are new versions.

  #### **When updating your branch with Master**:
    - `pip freeze > requirements.txt` creates a snapshot of all the dependencies you’ve installed to date. **Run this command when you are ready to create a pull request for your branch**.
      - This will capture any new packages you've installed in the development of your branch's feature, and will ensure they are not overwritten when the branch is pulled into Master.

## Styling w/ SASS, Bourbon + Neat
  #### SASS:
 - cd into project directory
 - `gem install sass`
 - To use it:
   - To run the compiler type this: `sass --watch assets/sass/app.scss:assets/compiled_css/app.css`
    - keep it running while you make changes in the
      scss files so you can see the changes reflected in the browser. **NB: you have to start this every time you start up your project, if you want SASS changes to be reflected.**
   - New SASS files go under `assets/sass`
   - Add the name of the file to the `app.scss`, for example:
     ```
     @import 'header';
     ```
 _NOTE:_ make the changes to stylesheets in the sass directory only. If you make changes
 in the app.css file in compiled_css/ directory, they will be removed when you run
 the sass --watch... command


  #### Bourbon & Neat:
 - make sure you're still in project directory
 - `gem install bourbon`
 - `gem install neat`
 - reload homepage to ensure bourbon & neat styling apply to view

## Install Mongo
  `pip install pymongo` and `brew install mongodb`
  To access Mongo server type `mongod` in your terminal at the root of your project (city-scape-app)

  - http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/tutorial.html

  Typing `mongo` in your terminal takes your to the MongoDB Shell.  You can see a list of everything in your database in this shell by doing the following:
  - `use cityscape`
  - `collection = db.cityscape`
  - `collection.find()`

## Tweepy Usage
  - ```pip install tweepy```
    #### Examples:
    - Enter python shell
      ```python manage.py shell```
    - Import Tweet class from tweet.py file:
      - ```from cityscape.tweet import Tweet```
    - Search for term ```t = Tweet.search("tacos")```
    - You can access a tweet's id: ```t[10].id```
      - returns a tweet id from the [10] index (can use this to input a value into the optional ```since_id``` argument)
    - Since_id is an optional argument to be entered into the search
      - ```t = Tweet.search("tacos",since_id=700443357609242625)```
    - ```len(t)``` will count the number tweets returned
    - The default limit for the # of tweets returned is 100 however this too can be changed as an optional argument as well.
      - ```t = Tweet.search("tacos", count=7)``` <-- this returns the most recent 7 tweets that match your search
